# ledit
A working Lisp editor

## Status

There is nothing here yet. You cannot use it. It is just a very rough plan.

## Clojure implementation

There is the beginnings of a Clojure implementation. This is probably just proof-of-concept rapid prototyping. Clojure makes it extremely hard to rebind symbols, so in-core editing of Clojure is going to be pretty hard to make work. It's highly likely that working LEdit will be Common Lisp only.
