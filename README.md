# ledit
A working Lisp editor

## Status

There is nothing here yet. You cannot use it. It is just a very rough plan.

## Clojure implementation

There is the beginnings of a Clojure implementation. This is probably just proof-of-concept rapid prototyping. Clojure makes it extremely hard to rebind symbols, so in-core editing of Clojure is going to be pretty hard to make work. It's highly likely that working LEdit will be Common Lisp only.

## Common Lisp implementation

There is the beginnings of a Common Lisp implementation. This will probably lag the Clojure implementation largely because I am personally more familiar with Clojure, but the long term aim is to get the Common Lisp implementation to a stage where it is a robust and usable tool.
